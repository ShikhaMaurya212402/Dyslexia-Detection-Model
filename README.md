# Dyslexia-Detection-Model
Early Detection. Empowering Learning.  This project presents an AI-powered system for the early detection of Dyslexia — a common learning disorder that affects reading 📖, writing ✍️, and language comprehension 🗣️. Early identification is crucial to provide timely support and personalized interventions.

🔎 Key Features:
📄 Text-based tasks — reading confusing words, tricky sentences, and analyzing reading patterns.

🗣️ Audio-based tasks — real-time speech-to-text transcription to evaluate reading speed, fluency, pronunciation, and accuracy.

✍️ Handwriting analysis — assessing handwritten letters, words, formation consistency, and fine motor skills to detect writing difficulties often linked with dyslexia.

🧩 Visual and memory tasks — pattern recognition and short-term memory exercises.

By combining insights from reading speed, speech clarity, handwriting patterns, and memory recall, the model aims to identify early signs of dyslexia with high sensitivity. 🧠✨

🔬 Technologies Used:
💻 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

🎙️ Speech Processing

✍️ Handwriting Recognition & Analysis

🤖 Machine Learning

🧑‍💻 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

This project strives to build an accessible, supportive tool for both educational and healthcare communities, making dyslexia screening more efficient and engaging. 🌟
